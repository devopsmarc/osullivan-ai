# **Why do so many AI projects fail?**
- Ecosystem should be seen as a research lab - you shouldn't aim for 100% success rate like in engineering
## **But, many projects are doomed to fail:**
- Technically infeasible or poorly scoped
- Never make the leap from demo or PoC to production 
- Unclear success criteria when demo or PoC arrive in production
- Poor ecosystem management
