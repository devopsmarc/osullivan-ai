<h4 style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abstract</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:0.8em; font-style:italic;">This paper presents a detailed analysis of the impact of transformer models in NLP, with a specific focus on their application in document summarization. The paper explores the role of transformers in both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques. Transformers have shown remarkable proficiency in producing summaries that are not only concise but also maintain the essence, coherence of the original documents and can handle longer texts and contexts, which was a limitation in previous NLP methodologies. This advancement allows for better encoding of lengthy articles and the generation of summaries that are closer to human-generated abstracts in terms of n-gram copying statistics. The paper concludes by emphasizing the transformative role of transformers in NLP, particularly in enhancing the quality and applicability of document summarization.</p>

#### 1. Introduction

<p style="text-align:justify;font-size;">NLP has been revolutionized by the advent of transformer models, which have driven recent advancements in the field. These models offer a state-of-the-art approach to various NLP tasks, such as document summarization. The transformers library opens up these developments to the wider machine learning community, serving as a curated collection of pre-trained models under a unified API [^1^].</p>

#### 2. Summarization and Transformers

<p style="text-align:justify; font-size;">Document summarization is an essential task in NLP that involves condensing long documents into concise summaries while preserving key information and overall meaning. Two main approaches dominate this task: extractive and abstractive summarization [^2^] [^4^]. Extractive methods select salient sentences or phrases directly from the source text, whereas abstractive methods generate new sentences that represent the main points of the text.

Transformers are being increasingly employed for both extractive and abstractive summarization tasks. An example of an abstractive summarization approach uses a simple extractive step to condition the transformer language model on relevant information before generating a summary [^2^]. This approach yields more abstractive summaries with higher scores compared to previous methods.</p>

#### 3. Problem-Solving Capabilities

<p style="text-align:justify; font-size;">One of the primary issues addressed by transformer-based models is the limitation of input and context length in current NLP tasks like automatic text summarization. Other methodologies can't fully encode longer articles, limiting their effectiveness. Transformer-based models, however, apply a recurrent mechanism to build abstractive summarizers for long texts, providing good performance even for longer documents.

Furthermore, transformer-based methods produce summaries that are more similar to human-generated abstracts. While purely extractive methods score higher for informativeness and relevance, transformers are ranked highly for coherence and fluency, providing a balance between readability and information retention.</p>

#### 4. Conclusion

In conclusion,the use of transformers in NLP has facilitated advancements in tasks such as document summarization. By addressing issues such as context length limitations and enhancing the quality of generated summaries, transformer-based models have proven to be instrumental in progressing NLP applications. As research continues, we can expect to see further improvements and new use cases for these models in the future. [^1^] [^2^] [^3^] [^4^] [^5^].
