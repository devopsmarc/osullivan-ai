## A general ecosystem framework

| Impact |      |        | Feasibility (e.g., cost) |
| ------ | ---- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| High   | (X)  |        | Low                     |
| Low    |  |     (X)    | High                    |
|        |      |        |                         |

- Where can we take advantage of cheap prediction?
- Where is there cost friction in our product?
- Where can we automate complicated manual processes?
- What are other people doing?
