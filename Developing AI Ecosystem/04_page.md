# **Why do so many AI projects fail?**
- An AI Ecosystem should be seen as a research lab - we need to understand all the AI components before starting our experiments
## **But, many projects are doomed to fail:**
- Technically infeasible or poorly scoped
- Never make the leap from demo or PoC to production 
- Unclear success criteria when demo or PoC arrive in production
- Poor ecosystem management
